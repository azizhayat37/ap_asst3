# S&P500 vs Volatility: Historical Investment Returns Visualization
# Abdulaziz Hayat - Advanced Programming: Assessment 3

Overview:
This is a basic web app designed to help a user model their profit/loss on a hedged portfolio based on two asset; the S&P500 Index, and the VIX Volatility Index, both of which are represented by their ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds).

Starting with the portfolio page, the user can create a basic hedged SP500 vs VIX portfolio. The user is free to weight their portfolio in either asset as they please. The user can then progress through the S&P500 page to see how they perform in a given time frame, and the same occurs on the Volatility page. ON both pages, the user will see their position, the entry and exit price for the investment (based on selected start and end dates), and the gross profit on the investment.

On the "Both Indices" page, the user can see how both sides of their hedged portfolio perform in the same time frame (as specified by the user). The idea is to visually and numerically highlight the inverese correlation between the performance of the two assets within the same time frame.
